# Prestashop 1.7 test module for Symfony architecture

Bare bones basic module boilerplate for creating and removing extra Database columns

 ### Requirements
 
  1. Composer, see [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to learn more
 
 ### How to install
 
  1. `cd` into module's directory and run following commands:
      - `composer install` - to download dependencies into vendor folder
      - `composer dumpautoload` to generate autoloader for module
  2. Install module from Back Office
 
 *Because the name of the directory and the name of the main module file must match.
